## Pizza

Dough [source here](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/pizza-dough-recipe-1921714)

- 4 cups all purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons (kosher) salt - crystals should be somewhat larger than table salt.
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 envelop dry yeast - 7g
- 1 1/2 cups water 110°F
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

Steps:

Use a mixer with a dough hook, and add the following in order.

1. Flour
2. Salt
3. Sugar
4. Yeast

Turn on the mixer to the lowest setting, and lock the arm.
Mix the dry ingredients for a minute.

Then add the following:

- Olive Oil
- Water

Continually do the following until the dough is a smooth cohesive mass that does not stick to the bowl or the mixer parts.
Add 1 tablespoon of water if the dough is too try
Add 1 tablespoon of flour if the dough is too sticky

Grease a bowl with olive oil. To conserve oil, you can use your fingers to spread it around.

Shape dough into a ball.

Place dough in the greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise for an hour.

30 minutes into the rising process, preheat the oven to highest setting. Usually 450°F - 500°F. This helps to ensure the oven is as warm as possible.

After the dough has risen for 1 hour, grease a metal cooking tray with olive oil, and shape the dough to fit. If you don't grease it, the pizza might stick, and fall apart when you try to remove it.

Place ingredients on pizza.

If using store bought pizza sauce, sprinkle the following on it after the sauce is on the pizza:

- Ground Black Pepper
- Italian Spices
- Granulated Garlic, or Garlic Powder

Cheese should be shredded mozzarella. Add just enough so you don't see the pizza sauce it covers.

Avoid adding overly watery topping - such as anything frozen, or certain types of tomatoes, or you will more likely end up with a wet pizza.

Bake (Conventional oven):
Bake 15-20 minutes at 500°F
If the oven doesn't go that high (toaster oven), bake 20-25 minutes at 450°F instead.

The pizza is usually done when the cheese starts to brown.
